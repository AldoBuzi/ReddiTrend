We agreed; they are family and are also tight on funds. We are happy to help and host them.\n\nHowever, they asked my husband last week if they could stay in our bedroom on their honeymoon. We have a two bedroom home, and our guest room has an air mattress that is used for when friends/family stay (otherwise, it is my work-from-home office, hence why we dont have a typical mattress in there). My BIL didn't really get into the specifics of why they didn't want the guest bedroom/air mattress, but the gist seemed to be \"we dont think an air mattress is honeymoon appropriate\".\n\nWhen my husband asked me about it, I was honest with him and said I wasn't comfortable with his brother and his new wife sleeping in our bed on their honeymoon. My husband agreed with me.\n\nApparently us saying no to this request has caused some issue in my husband's family, particularly with his sister whos saying we should just let BIL and his future wife stay in our room as \"it is THEIR honeymoon and they shouldn't have to sleep on an air mattress\".\n\nWe love everyone in this scenario, especially BIL and his future wife, and don't want to cause a rift so my husband is sort of leaning towards acquiesing to their request, however, I am not down to change my mind on this.

I was admitted not too long after my original post after experiencing some incredibly intense pain. \n\nSurgery hasn't worked how we hoped, the trial combination chemo hasn't worked as we hoped, and I am far too sick to even attempt it again. \n\nThe reality of the cancer growth, my own health, and ability to fight back, on top of other mitigating factors. It's now come to a point of just making myself comfortable. \n\nWhen I first posted about my Steamdeck, I was wanting to play games for nostalgia, games I had missed, but with a change in the wind, so does my priorities. \n\nSo, I ask, \n\nWhat games should I play before I die? \n\nPlease think deeply on this, and drop your recommendation. \n\nIf anyone wants to drop a private message to talk about my diagnosis or what the final few months look like, by all means please don't hesitate. I am more than open to discuss it. \n\nAll the best\nM\n\n\n\n",

My sister was supposed to be watching her. I came home literally two minutes later. She was bleeding and having trouble breathing. We took her to the vet immediately and they said we had to either put her to sleep or pay 3000$ for her intensive care, which only had a 50% of survival as she was bleeding from her lungs. We decided to let her go as we couldn't afford it. I was so sad, I can't stop crying. It's been around 2 hours since I last saw her. She was just a baby. The veterans were kind enough to let me pet her before and after they put her to sleep. I sat with her for 15 minutes I think before I had to finally say goodbye and leave her. I kept her collar. I'm crying as I type this because she was my everything. There's no one to jump on me in the mornings anymore, no one to try and open the door when I'm in the bathroom, and no one to sleep on me anymore. I miss when she'd sleep on my legs, sleep in the middle of my bed so I only had to sleep on the edge. I miss everything about her so much. I have school tomorrow, and my birthday is in two days. I don't know if I should celebrate, or if I even want to. Anyways, here are some photos of her. She was so cute and energetic, and she was very fierce yet playful and social. Her name was Lia.\n\n",

My sister was supposed to be watching her. I came home literally two minutes later. She was bleeding and having trouble breathing. We took her to the vet immediately and they said we had to either put her to sleep or pay 3000$ for her intensive care, which only had a 50% of survival as she was bleeding from her lungs. We decided to let her go as we couldn't afford it. I was so sad, I can't stop crying. It's been around 2 hours since I last saw her. She was just a baby. The veterans were kind enough to let me pet her before and after they put her to sleep. I sat with her for 15 minutes I think before I had to finally say goodbye and leave her. I kept her collar. I'm crying as I type this because she was my everything. There's no one to jump on me in the mornings anymore, no one to try and open the door when I'm in the bathroom, and no one to sleep on me anymore. I miss when she'd sleep on my legs, sleep in the middle of my bed so I only had to sleep on the edge. I miss everything about her so much. I have school tomorrow, and my birthday is in two days. I don't know if I should celebrate, or if I even want to. Anyways, here are some photos of her. She was so cute and energetic, and she was very fierce yet playful and social. Her name was Lia.\n\n",
